# Inventory Tracking App

Welcome to the Inventory Tracking App! This project is a Next.js application built with TypeScript that allows users to manage products and their inventory levels. The app includes features for product management, inventory tracking, and a product listing interface.

## Features

- **Product Management:** Create, update, and delete products with fields for name, description, price, and stock level.
- **Inventory Management:** Add to or subtract from a product's inventory and track changes.
- **Product Listing:** View a list of products with details and use search and filtering functionality to find specific items.
- **History Tracking:** View the history of inventory changes for each product.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-inventory-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd my-inventory-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **React Hook Form**: A library for managing form state and validation.

## Code Quality & Structure

- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and maintainability.
- **Clean Code**: Code is organized into components, API routes, and services to ensure readability and reusability.
- **Documentation**: Each function and component is documented with comments to describe its purpose and usage.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Persistence**: This implementation uses in-memory storage for simplicity. For production use, consider integrating a database for persistent data storage.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented, but further refinement might be needed for edge cases and user feedback.
